Game Of Life in Python
======================
This is a basic life simulation that follows four rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell

A neighbor is deemed as any cell directly horizantal / vertical / diagonal
meaning there are 9 neighbors to a cell at any time.
